# LangGraph Agentic Coder

**Agentic Coder Built Using LangGraph to Orchestrate Multiple Agents to follow Test Driven Development for Developing Software**

_Development Flow: Plan -> Blackbox Tests -> Code -> Correct -> Repeat_

The development process follows the Red-Green-Refactor Cycle of Test Driven Development

The Planning Agent is expected to plan the development of the project:

- Plan the software architecture
- Decide the technical details and the requirements for the project
- Communicate the requirements with the Testing Agent

The Testing Agent is expected to:

- Develop a testing plan for the software
- Document the testing plan
- Develop testcases according to the testing plan

The Coding Agent is expected to:

- Implement the software according to the plan
- Debug or Refactor the code until all test cases pass
